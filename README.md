# Machine Learning model with python and flask

In this project I generated a robust machine learning model. I used different models and with hyperparameter optimizer find the best model for this project. 
I used flask to deploy the model in an application that simulates a production output.

## Libraries

 * pandas
 * numpy
 * joblib
 * sklearn
 
## Dataset
